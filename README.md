# `nerdy.nix`

## WIP

A helpful little flake to save me some pain when allocating nerd-font glyphs to different Nix configurations :)

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements

`nerd.nix` is heavily inspired by the following repositories:

- [nerdy.nvim](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/nerdy.nvim)
- [rofi-nerdy](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/rofi-nerdy)
- And the obvious... nerd-font glyphs themselves
